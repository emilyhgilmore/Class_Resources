# HW 4 nucleotide ambiguity codes

**Assigned:** 4 September, Class 5

**Due:** 27 September, Class 12

Fill in *HW_4.ipynb* and turn it in. 
Your turned-in copy should **only** have the stuff that the worksheet asks for. 
If you add extra stuff to the worksheet, for example to try things out, and you want to keep that stuff, 
please keep it in a copy of the notebook rather than in the copy you turn in.
